# Velocity-Template-Language-Java

I need someone to change a dynamic HTML table code which is currently 2 colums to 4 columns. The table draws items from a list (array) that can be different sizes and therefor I need a new row after 4 items, empty table cells before the row closes for less than 4 items per row. This should be dynamic and work with any number of items in my list.
The language used to draw the data is Velocity Template Language but apart from using velocityCount and file.size() there is nothing complicated on that end, anyone with Java knowledge can probably do it.

This is probably a 5 minute fix but I am stuck at how to do the calculations via modulo.
The code to change is attached
